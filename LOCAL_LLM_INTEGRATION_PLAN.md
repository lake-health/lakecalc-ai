# Local LLM Integration Plan

## 🎯 Vision
Replace expensive external LLM API calls with a fine-tuned local model that learns from your biometry data and improves over time.

## 📊 Cost Analysis
- **External LLM**: $0.25-0.30 per request
- **Local LLM**: $0.00 per request (after setup)
- **Break-even**: Immediate - first request saves money!

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Testing (This Week)
```bash
# 1. Install Ollama
brew install ollama

# 2. Start service
ollama serve

# 3. Download models
ollama pull codellama:7b    # Best for structured data
ollama pull llama2:7b       # Good general model
ollama pull mistral:7b      # Fast alternative
```

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept (Next Week)
- ✅ Test with existing biometry data
- ✅ Compare accuracy vs regex parsers
- ✅ Measure inference speed
- ✅ Validate structured output

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Month 1)
- Collect 50-100 anonymized biometry reports
- Create training dataset (input text → JSON output)
- Fine-tune model with LoRA/QLoRA
- A/B test against existing parsers

### Phase 4: Production Integration (Month 2)
- Replace external LLM calls in universal parser
- Add continuous learning feedback loop
- Monitor performance and accuracy
- Scale to handle production load

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Current Flow:
```
PDF → OCR → External LLM API → JSON
     ↓
$0.25-0.30 per request
```

### New Flow:
```
PDF → OCR → Local Fine-Tuned LLM → JSON
     ↓
$0.00 per request
```

### Integration Points:
1. **Universal Parser**: Replace `LLMProcessor` with `LocalLLMProcessor`
2. **Cost Tracker**: Update to track local inference time instead of API costs
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Local LLM → Device-specific regex → Manual review

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### Immediate:
- **Zero ongoing costs** for LLM parsing
- **No API rate limits** or usage caps
- **Complete data privacy** - no external calls
- **Faster inference** - no network latency

### Long-term:
- **Improves with more data** - learns from every upload
- **Handles new devices** automatically
- **Custom biometry expertise** - understands your specific formats
- **Scalable** - no per-request costs as you grow

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Accuracy:
- Match or exceed regex parser accuracy: >95%
- Handle edge cases better than external LLM
- Consistent output format

### Performance:
- Inference time: <5 seconds per document
- Memory usage: <8GB RAM
- CPU usage: <50% during inference

### Cost:
- $0.00 per request (vs $0.25-0.30 external)
- Break-even: Immediate
- ROI: Infinite after setup

## 🔄 Continuous Learning Strategy

### Data Collection:
- Store successful extractions with confidence scores
- Collect user corrections and feedback
- Monitor parsing failures and edge cases

### Model Updates:
- Retrain monthly with new data
- A/B test new models against current
- Gradual rollout of improvements

### Quality Assurance:
- Automated testing with known good data
- Human review of edge cases
- Performance monitoring and alerts
