## LLM Model Change (September 2025)

The default LLM model for field extraction is now `gpt-4o-mini` (see `app/utils.py`).

- The OpenAI API call uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens` for compatibility with newer models.
- Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable locally and on Railway.
- You can override the model by passing a different model name to the utility function if needed.

**Note:** Using GPT-4o or GPT-5 models may have different cost and latency profiles compared to previous models. Monitor your usage accordingly.
