# Biometry Parser Reality Check

## The Real Challenge

**Most biometry reports are IMAGE-BASED PDFs, not text-based PDFs.**

This is why biometry parsing is such a difficult problem and why our LLM approach is revolutionary.

## Document Types in Practice

### Image-Based PDFs (95% of real cases)
- Scanned biometry reports from devices
- Printed reports that were scanned
- Photos of screen displays
- These require: **OCR → LLM** pipeline

### Text-Based PDFs (5% of cases)
- Digital exports from devices
- Reports generated directly to PDF
- These can use: **Direct text extraction → LLM**

## Current System Status

✅ **Text-based PDFs:** Working perfectly with LLM
❌ **Image-based PDFs:** Need OCR integration

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate OCR** (Tesseract/EasyOCR) for image-based PDFs
2. **Test with real image-based biometry reports**
3. **Validate OCR → LLM pipeline accuracy**
4. **Handle mixed documents** (some text, some images)

## Why This Matters

- **Without OCR:** System only works with 5% of real documents
- **With OCR + LLM:** Universal biometry agent that works with 95% of real documents
- **This is the killer differentiator:** Most solutions fail on image-based documents

## Test Files Analysis

From our testing:
- `2935194_franciosi_carina_2024.10.01 18_00_37_IOL.pdf` - Image-based (failed text extraction)
- `BIO - EXTERNO - GERALDO JOSE FILIAGI - CAROL.pdf` - Text-based (worked perfectly)

This confirms the reality: **Most real biometry reports are image-based!**
